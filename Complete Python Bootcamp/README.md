## Projects Overview

Below is a list of the projects included in this directory:

1. **Blackjack Game (Player vs. Computer)**
   - A console-based Blackjack game where a player competes against a computer. The game involves card dealing, point calculation, and determining the winner based on the players' scores.

2. **Web Scraper: Link Finder**

   - A two-player console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where players alternate between 'X' and 'O' to form a winning combination. The script checks for valid moves and detects if a player has won or if the game ends in a draw.

4. **Fibonacci Sequence Generator**
   - A script that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a user-defined maximum value. The sequence is printed until the next Fibonacci number exceeds the specified limit.

5. **Change Calculator**
   - A program that calculates and returns the breakdown of change (in dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies) for a given cost and paid amount. The script ensures that the paid amount is greater than the cost and handles invalid input.
